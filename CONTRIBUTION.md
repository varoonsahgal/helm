## Best practices

When ever you think there is too much text, but that it is necessary, please use the `details` tag to make the text toggleable, by clicking the arrow:

<details>
    <summary>A Hint</summary>
    It helps reducing the amount of word overload that we sometimes write
</details>

The code to make this happen is the following:

```markdown
<details>
    <summary>Hint</summary>
        All markdown in here is hidden in an expandable field
</details>
```
